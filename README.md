ODIN PROJECT
=============
Recipes
-------
In this Project I will demonstrate my newly acquired basic HTML skills.
I will demonstrate it by making a **Recipe Page**.

**Needed Skills**
* Basic Boilerplate
* Making Lists - Unsorted/Sorted
* Adding Links - Absolute/Relative
* Adding Images
* Adding Links with safety features

**Self-Reflection**
The Project went well, because I did HTML around 2 years ago and could remember pretty much everything.
One thing was new, the safety feature "noopener noreferrer" for Links.
Overall the Project was a good refresh of my skills.
